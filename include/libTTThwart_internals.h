/*
	Function: check_parameters_properties

    Checks properties of the given parameters, this is, the given path and 
    inode. Checking properties in this context means checking if a 
    <file_object_info> with the same path already exists in the array. If it
    doesn't, insert it; othwerwise (if it does) compare 
    the given inode and the inode of the <file_object_info> as well as the
    file mode and the device id. If they're equal continue execution; otherwise
    abort execution because a possible TOCTTOU is detected.

    Checking parameters is different based on the FILE SYSTEM of the given path.
    At the moment, the function only considers two file systems:

    	- EXT2/EXT3/EXT4 (their magic number is the same). When the path is located
    	in a ext2/3/4 file system, temporal hardlinks are created in order to
    	ensure the inode is not reused. One "feature" of such filesystems is that 
    	they reuse inode as soon as a given inode has 0 links pointing to it. 
    	- OTHER FS. When the path is allocated on any other possible file system
    	the checkings performed are the same with the exception of temporal hard
    	links creation. We do not need hard links because inodes are not reused. 

    In order to see this function initialization, please refer to <get_fs_and_initialize_checking_functions>.

    Parameters:
    	path - absolute path of the file whose metadata must be checked.
    	caller_function_name -  name of the function from which the checking was
    		called.
