	Pointer to function: upsert_file_data_in_array

	Upserts (updates or inserts) the corresponding data of a given file into the
	global structure (array) that's used to assure files consistency between 
	operations. The data that's being saved is:
		- Inode
		- Device ID
		- File Mode
		- Absolute path
		- Path o temporal link (optional, defaults to NULL)

	In addition, some operations are as well performed in order to harden race
	conditions exploitability. I.e:
		- When function gets invoked, one of the parameters it receives is the
		actual inode corresponding to the given path (the inode is obtained 
		elsewhere). The function then obtains the inode of the given path (amongst
		many other metadata such as the device id) and compares them. If they're
		not equal, the program shall be aborted. 

	It's a function pointer because depending on the actual FS its implementation
	will be different.

/*
	Function: upsert_file_data_in_array_ext3ext4

	Implementation of upsert_file_data_in_array for ext3 and ext4 file systems. 
	The main difference is that these filesystems reuse inodes so hardlinks must
	be created in order to ensure inode consistency.

    Inserts into the given array the given path and inode. Before inserting elements
    into the given array, the array must be initialized. If there is not enough 
    room in the array to insert a new <file_object_info> element, the size of 
    the array gets doubled. After the element is inserted, "used" member of the 
    given array is postincremented. If the path already exists in the array, the 
    function updates the corresponding inode instead of inserting new element.

    Parameters: 
    	array - <file_objects_info> array to insert into.
    	path - Sanitized path to insert.
    	inode - Inode to insert.
    	tmp_dir - Temporal hardlinks directory to insert, in case there's any.

	Function: upsert_file_data_in_array_otherfs

	Implementation of upsert_file_data_in_array for other FS than ext3 and ext4.
	As far as I am concerned as of right now, there is no need to ensure inode
	consistency because only ext3 and ext4 reuse them. Last 
	
	Parameters:
    	array - <file_objects_info> array to insert into.
    	path - Sanitized path to insert.
    	inode - Inode to insert.
    	tmp_dir - Temporal hardlinks directory to insert, in case there's any.

    Initializes the given <file_objects_info> array with the given size, allocating
    the corresponding memory. The allocation is made via <calloc> and the function
    performs error checking. 

    Parameters:
    	array - Pointer to <file_objects_info> array to initialize.

	Inserts into the given array the <file_object_info> entry with the given path
	and inode as well as other metadata just like <upsert_file_data_in_array_otherfs>
	does. The difference is that the inode will be 0 (zero), the temporal path will
	be null while device_id and file_mode will get ther default (int) value.

	Parameters:
		array - <file_objects_info> array to insert into.
    	path - Sanitized path to insert.

/*
	Function: find_index_in_array

    Find the index of the given path in the given array. The first check performed
    is asserting array size is bigger than 0 (zero) because othwerwise means the
    array has not yet been initialized, so there is no way the element could be 
    found in it. If array size is bigger than 0 (zero) the search is performed in
    linear, sequential manner. From the first element to the last.

    Parameters:
		array - Array of type <file_objects_info> to go across and search in. 
		Path - Path to search. 

    Returns:
    	Index of the element (if found); otherwise -1.

		index - Index (postion) from "array" to delete.
